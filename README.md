## Rescuing Leftovers, Reviving Communities

The phrase “food for all”, is often attributed to zero hunger; but its relevance extends to alleviating shortage of food, reducing malnutrition, and bridging the gap between scarcity and surplus. In a society abundant with resources, the unsettling paradox of excessive wastage of food further aggravates the causes of hunger and the myriad of associated issues. This presents a pressing concern to address challenges intertwined with hunger and an opportunity to ensure everyone stays nourished.

In this context, HungerHalt aims to not only provide a solution to reduce food wastage and optimize the quantity of raw materials to be purchased based on consumers, but also a medium to redistribute unprocessed or processed items between stores, restaurants, and any entity in the ‘consumable products’ sector and facilitate in clearing items closer to expiration to those in need. From mitigating wastage to providing food at inexpensive rates much lower than market price as well as a provision of free-of-charge resources, our work seeks to ensure optimal resource utilization and contribute to the pursuit of zero hunger.
